In today's digital landscape, managing the flow of requests to your server is crucial, especially when dealing with high traffic. Rate limiting ensures that no single user or IP address overwhelms your system by sending too many requests in a short period. In this post, I'll walk you through creating an efficient rate-limiting algorithm in Swift, breaking down the code into simple steps.

# Understanding the Problem

Imagine you’re building a service that receives thousands of requests per second. To prevent abuse, you decide to limit the number of requests each IP address can make within a one-second window. Any additional requests beyond this limit should be rejected.

To solve this, we need an algorithm that:

- Tracks the number of requests made by each IP address.
- Enforces the limit within a rolling one-second window.
- Efficiently handles large volumes of data without slowing down.

# The Initial Setup

We start by defining a function that will take a list of requests and the rate limit (in requests per second). Each request contains an ID, an IP address, and a timestamp indicating when the request was made.

```swift
func rejectedRequests(requests: [String], limitPerSec: Int) -> [Int] {
    var rejectedIndices: [Int] = []
    var ipRequestCount: [String: [Int: Int]] = [:] // [IP: [Timestamp: Count]]
```

- **rejectedIndices:** An array that will store the IDs of requests that exceed the limit.
- **ipRequestCount:** A dictionary to track how many requests each IP address has made at specific seconds.

# Processing Each Request

We loop through each request, splitting it into its ID, IP address, and timestamp.

```swift
for (index, request) in requests.enumerated() {
    let parts = request.split(separator: " ")
    guard parts.count == 3,
          let id = Int(parts[0]),
          let timestamp = Int(parts[2]) else {
        continue // Skip malformed requests
    }
    let ip = String(parts[1])
```

- Guard Statement: Ensures the request is valid (it has exactly three parts, and the ID and timestamp are integers). If not, the request is skipped.

# Tracking Requests by IP Address

Next, we initialize tracking for each IP address if it hasn’t been seen before.

```swift
if ipRequestCount[ip] == nil {
    ipRequestCount[ip] = [:]
}
```

This step ensures that we have a place to store the count of requests for each timestamp associated with the IP address.

# Cleaning Up Old Data

To ensure our algorithm only considers requests made within the last second, we remove any timestamps that are too old.

- Why Clean Up?: Old timestamps are irrelevant and could lead to incorrect calculations. Removing them keeps our data structure lean and focused only on recent activity.

# Counting Requests in the Last Second

We then sum up all the requests made by this IP address in the last second.

```swift
let requestInLastSecond = ipRequestCount[ip]!.values.reduce(0, +)
```

- This sum tells us how many requests have been made recently and helps us decide if the current request should be accepted or rejected.

# Accepting or Rejecting Requests

Based on the count, we either reject the request (if it exceeds the limit) or accept it and update our records.

```swift
if requestInLastSecond >= limitPerSecond {
    rejectedIndices.append(id)
} else {
    ipRequestCount[ip]![timestamp, default: 0] += 1
}
```

- **Rejected Requests:** If the sum of recent requests meets or exceeds the limit, the current request is rejected.
- **Accepted Requests:** If the request count is below the limit, we add the current request to our tracking dictionary.

# Returning the Rejected Requests

Finally, after processing all requests, we return the list of rejected request IDs.

```swift
return rejectedIndices
```

# Testing the Function

To ensure our function works correctly, we can test it with a few cases:

```swift
let test1 = rejectedRequests(requests: ["1 172.253.115.138 50000", "2 172.253.115.139 50100", "3 172.253.115.138 50210", "4 172.253.115.139 50300", "5 172.253.115.138 51000", "6 172.253.115.139 60300"], limitPerSecond: 1)
print("Test 1 result:", test1) // Expected: [3, 4]

let test2 = rejectedRequests(requests: ["10 172.253.115.138 50000", "20 172.253.115.138 50000", "30 172.253.115.138 50000"], limitPerSecond: 2)
print("Test 2 result:", test2) // Expected: [30]

let test3 = rejectedRequests(requests: ["1 172.253.115.138 50000", "2 172.253.115.138 50900", "3 172.253.115.138 51000", "4 172.253.115.138 51500"], limitPerSecond: 2)
print("Test 3 result:", test3) // Expected: [4]
```

# Conclusion

By following this approach, you can build a robust rate-limiting mechanism in Swift that efficiently handles large numbers of requests while ensuring no single IP address can flood your system. This method balances simplicity with performance, making it an ideal solution for real-world applications.

Whether you're working on a backend server or building a mobile app, understanding and implementing rate limiting is crucial for maintaining system stability and preventing abuse. With this guide, you now have the tools to implement your own rate limiter in Swift, tailored to your specific needs. Happy coding!
