# Swift Concurrency Notes ðŸ§µ

## **@MainActor**

- The @MainActor attribute in Swift is used to ensure that certain parts of your code always run on the main thread. This is particular useful in SwiftUI, where UI updates must be performed on the main thread.

- SwiftUI views are implicit **@MainActors** when they have **@ObservableObject** properties like @StateObject, @ObservedObject and @EnvironmentObject

```swift
struct MyView: View {
 @StateObject var vm = MyViewModel()

 var body: some View {
   Button {
     Task {
        await performSomeWork()
      }
    } label: {
      Text("Test")
      }
   }
}
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ await doesnâ€™t block current thread. It allows suspension of the current task. Essentially, we just say Iâ€™m gonna wait a lil bit, so let other things happen on main thread while Iâ€™m doing that long-term process like heavy network things.

</aside>

```swift
func someVerySlowOperation() async {
   // this takes a while...
} 

await MainActor.run {
  await someVerySlowOperation()
}
```

- How can we know the current task is not on main thread?

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ The system doesnâ€™t care where you call sth from. Instead, functions decide where should call

</aside>

```swift
class MyViewModel: ObservableObject {
  // this will always run on the Global executor
   func performSomeWork() async {
      
    }
}
```

- Changing the execution context

```swift
class MyViewModel: ObservableObject {
  // this will always run on the Main actor / thread
  @MainActor func performSomeWork() async {

  }
}
```

- Opting out of **MainActor** isolation

```swift
@MainActor
class MyViewModel: ObservableObject {
  // this will _not_ run on the Main actor / thread
  nonisolated func performSomeWork() async {
  
  }
}
```

- Async functions will run on the global executor unless they were specifically instructed to not do that

- Trickier example:
    
    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡ SwiftUI Views get an implicit Main Actor annotation when they hold an ObservableObejct!
    
    </aside>
    

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  @StateObject var myViewModel = MyViewModel()

var body: some View {
  Button("Test") {
   	Task { 
      await someExpensiveOperation()
    }
   }
 }

**Where does this function work?** 
	// Since usage of @StateObject, @ObservedObject and @EnvironmentObject properties
  // Struct gains implicit MainActor behaviour. 
  // So, the answer is this function also work on **Main actor / thread**
private func someExpensiveOperation() async {
  
 }
}
```

Recap: 

ðŸŒŸÂ Key rule: Functions run on the global executor unless otherwise specified.

ðŸŒŸÂ Mark method or enclosing object as @MainActor to enforce main actor

ðŸŒŸÂ Use nonisolated to **opt out** MainActor isolation

ðŸŒŸÂ SwiftUI views with ObservableObjects are implicitly @MainActor.

## Task

In Swift Concurrency, a Task represents a unit of work. There are two types of tasks: unstructured and detached. Unstructured tasks inherit parts of their creation context, but they are not child tasks of their creation context. Detached tasks, on the other hand, do not inherit anything. Both types of tasks can work in parallel with other tasks and do not interact with other tasks.

- Creating an **unstructured** Task
    
    ```swift
    Task {
    // I'm an unstructured task
    }
    ```
    
- Creating a **detached** Task
    
    ```swift
    Task.detached {
     // I'm a detached task
    }
    ```
    

- **What happens when we create a Taskâ€¦**

ðŸŒŸÂ Unstructured tasks inherits parts of their creation context.

ðŸŒŸÂ Unstructured tasks are not child tasks of their creation context.

ðŸŒŸÂ Detached tasks inherit nothing.

ðŸŒŸÂ Both tasks are their own islands of concurrency. They can work in parallel other with concurrent tasks. They donâ€™t interact with other tasks which means only interact within their own islands.

## Structured concurrency relates to tasks and their children

- Structured tasks cannot leave any uncompleted child tasks before it finishes.
- All child tasks should be completed before the parent tasks completion in Structured tasks.
- Unstructured tasks can be live out of scope.
- In Unstructured tasks, child tasks no longer live than parent tasks. When the parent task is over all related children tasks will be over as well.

## Example

In this example, `withTaskGroup` is used to create a new task group. Inside the task group, a new child task is spawned to run the `longRunningTask` function. 
The `for await` loop is used to wait for all child tasks to finish and collect their results. 
The result of the task group is the sum of the results of all child tasks. 
This is an example of structured concurrency because the parent task (the task group) cannot finish until all its child tasks have finished.

```swift
// Define a function that simulates a long-running task
func longRunningTask() async -> Int {
    print("Starting long running task...")
    await Task.sleep(2 * 1_000_000_000)  // Sleep for 2 seconds
    print("Long running task finished.")
    return 42
}

// Define a function that uses structured concurrency to run the long-running task
func runTask() async {
    let result = await withTaskGroup(of: Int.self) { group -> Int in
        // Spawn a new child task
        group.spawn {
            await longRunningTask()
        }

        // Wait for all child tasks to finish and collect the results
        var total = 0
        for await result in group {
            total += result
        }
        return total
    }
    print("Result: \(result)")
}

// Run the task
Task {
    await runTask()
}
```

## Example

```swift
// safe because whole class (including both property and method) is actor-isolated; `Task {â€¦}` will be actor isolated, too
@MainActor
class SafeActorIsolatedClassExample {
    var foo = Foo(bar: "baz")
    
    func thisIsSafe() {
        Task {
            foo.bar = "qux"
        }
    }
}

// safe because both property and method are actor-isolated to same global actor; `Task {â€¦}` will be actor isolated, too
class SafeActorIsolatedPropertyAndMethodExample {
    @MainActor var foo = Foo(bar: "baz")
    
    @MainActor func thisIsSafe() {
        Task {
            foo.bar = "qux"
        }
    }
}

// safe because `UIViewController` is actor-isolated to `@MainActor`, 
// and therefore behaves like `SafeActorIsolatedClassExample`
// @available(iOS 2.0, *)
// @MainActor open class UIViewController :

class SafeViewController: UIViewController {
    var foo = Foo(bar: "baz")
    
    func thisIsSafe() {
        Task {
            foo.bar = "qux"
        }
    }
}
```
