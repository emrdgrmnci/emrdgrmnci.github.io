Then someone (licensed translator) does the translation in POEditor manually. After that, you should be able to fetch them (either manually or automatically) from POEditor.","how-do-we-extractimport-translations-fromto-poeditor-automatically#How do we extract/import translations from/to POEditor automatically?":"We can either manually send the new strings to poeditor.com using fastlane translations_extract fastlane script or GitLab CI doing it for us automatically.

Designing your apps with accessibility in mind helps everyone use them, including people with vision, or hearing disabilities.\nVoiceOver is a screen reader built into Apple Inc.‚Äôs macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS, and iPod operating systems. By using VoiceOver, the user can access their Macintosh or iOS device based on spoken descriptions and, in the case of the Mac, the keyboard.","why-accessibility#Why Accessibility?":"In my current company, we‚Äôre also supporting Accessibilities, especially VoiceOver. In our e-paper applications, we have active 2K blind users.\nYou‚Äôll reach a larger group.\nIt feels good to know you‚Äôre making a noticeable difference in more people‚Äôs life.","how-to-activate-and-use-voiceover#How to Activate and Use VoiceOver?":"You can find detailed information about activation and usage of VoiceOver on iPhone on Apple‚Äôs website:\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph3e2e415f/ios\nSingle-tap anywhere and VoiceOver will read information from the item‚Äôs accessibility attributes loudly.\nSingle-swipe left or right and VoiceOver will select the next visible accessibility item and read it loudly.\nSingle-swipe down to spell the focused item letter-by-letter.\nDouble-tap to select the specific item.\nThree-finger-swipe left or right to navigate forward or backward in a page view.\n\nFor the complete list of VoiceOver gestures, check out Apple‚Äôs Learn VoiceOver gestures on iPhone.

In this time period, I‚Äôve worked in 3 different companies in Turkey as an iOS Developer.Now, I‚Äôve been working at Textalk Media which is a Sweden company works in the Media Technology Industry since 1979 for the past 1 month. This is the very first company that I work abroad for. During this short timeframe, I‚Äôve seen some differences between my past companies and Textalk Media‚Äôs technical scale and products.\nOur Swedish(European) counterparts are deemed happier, healthier, and more productive while working fewer hours, having longer breaks, and more paid vacation.‚Äù https://usalinksystem.com/whats-new/details/6-differences-in-work-culture-between-the-us-and-europe-284\n\nWork culture in Europe and Turkey is like black and white.\nIn Turkey, many employees and some employers (but not so much) are still experimenting to find the perfect work-life balance.","work-hours#Work hours":"In Turkish companies, I was working at least 9 hours per day and 45 hours per week. But, it was not enough for Turkish managers, and they always wait for more hours to work without paying extra money. I was able to endure this bullying for just 3 years ü§Ø. Finally, I burnt out and changed company.In a Swedish company, I am working 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week. And of course, every Friday we have fika time at 15:00 CET and after that, we don‚Äôt work. My company doesn‚Äôt know anything about overtime and always cares about employees‚Äô mental health and decisions.","more-vacation-time#More vacation time":"In Turkish companies, I don‚Äôt remember any time that I used for vacation more than 1 week. On top of it, you have this opportunity if you have been working in that company for at least 1 year.In a Swedish company, I have 25 days of paid vacation (the vacation earning year is April 1 to March 31). I‚Äôm pretty sure no one will disturb me when I will get a vacation ü§†","lunchtime#Lunchtime":"In Turkish companies, this was around a maximum of 30 minutes for me.\n‚ÄúIn Sweden, they have a common practice called fika. Fika at the workplace translates to two 10‚Äì30-minute breaks, one in the morning and another in the afternoon.

If we do not act hastily and proceed in a more humane way, a higher-quality job will emerge.\nEuropean governments and businesses are looking after their people to boost productivity and improve workers‚Äô work-life balance. https://usalinksystem.com/whats-new/details/6-differences-in-work-culture-between-the-us-and-europe-284\nSee you soon :)"}}}
